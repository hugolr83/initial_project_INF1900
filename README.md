# initial_project_INF1900
 IInitial on-board system project with Polymtl 

In the project folder, you can find all the files necessary to realize the project. 
The folder lcm is a library which was given to us. We build our proper library to use our own code for this project. 
The folder test regroups all the tests we made to make the robot almost perfect. 
Finally the folder tp was our weekly pratical work to learn how works our atmega mostly.
